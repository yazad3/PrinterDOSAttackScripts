# PrinterDOSAttackScripts
This repository contains very basic Linux shell scripts to attack a network printer. Note that this is a purely academic exercise and should not under any circumstances be used to attack a system you do not own. If you do so, you are solely responsible for this activity and not the author of this tool.  The goal is to understand and hence protect network computing assets like Printers, Scanners, Copiers and Faxes which are increasingly becoming more complex and powerful computing devices that can do a lot more than what they were originally intended for.
